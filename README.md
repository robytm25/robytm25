# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Robert

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a Full Stack Junior Java Developer transitioning to Python-Django, currently working on building a web application.

## About Me

* I recently completed a 9-month Full Stack Java Developer course, gaining a solid foundation in backend and frontend development.
* Currently, at _VOIS, beside my day by day workflow,  I'm diving into Python and Django, building a full-stack web application from scratch. This is a challenging but exciting opportunity to expand my skillset.
* I'm eager to learn and grow as a developer, and I'm particularly interested in exploring the Python ecosystem and building robust web applications.

## My Skills (Expanding)

* **Languages:** Java, Python (learning), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL
* **Frameworks:** Spring Boot (familiar), Django (learning)
* **Tools:** Git, IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, Docker, SQL

## Featured Projects

* **Vending Machine** A Java console application simulating a vending machine. Users can select items, insert money, and receive their purchase with correct change. https://github.com/robytm25/Vendingmachine
* **Fleet Management System** A Fleet Management System designed to track and manage a group of vehicles. It handles vehicle information, maintenance schedules, and potentially other fleet-related operations. https://github.com/robytm25/Vendingmachine

## Current Focus

* Building a full-stack web application using Python-Django for my team
* Deepening my understanding of the Django framework and best practices.
* Improving my Python proficiency.
* Learning Docker containerization, implementing CI/CD pipelines.
